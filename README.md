# VSGenerator

**DVSNet: Dynamic Virtual Space Generation Neural Network**
[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/VSGenerator.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/VSGenerator/)

## Overview

`VSGenerator` introduces **DVSNet**, a neural network designed for dynamically generating virtual spaces to enhance training datasets. This project extends the capabilities of the [Bgolearn](https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn) platform, with a particular focus on neural network applications in **materials design**. By leveraging `DVSNet`, researchers can efficiently construct diverse and adaptive virtual environments for data-driven exploration.  

## Installation

Install `VSGenerator` via pip:  

```bash
pip install VSGenerator
```

## Usage

Refer to the [`./tutorial`](https://github.com/Bgolearn/VSGenerator/blob/main/tutorial/VSGenerator_Tutorial.ipynb) directory for detailed usage examples.

## License

This project is licensed under the **MIT License**. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.



We appreciate your interest in `VSGenerator` and `Bgolearn`—happy researching! 🚀
